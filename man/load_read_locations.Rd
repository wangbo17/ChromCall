\title{Load Reads from a BAM File as Central Points}
\usage{
load_read_locations(file, paired)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to a BAM file. Must be coordinate-sorted and indexed (BAI file required).}

\item{paired}{Logical. If TRUE (default), input BAM is assumed to be paired-end
and reads are loaded as fragments. If FALSE, input BAM is treated as single-end.}
}
\value{
A \link[GenomicRanges:GRanges-class]{GenomicRanges::GRanges} object, with each read resized to a single base
at its center.
}
\description{
Load aligned sequencing reads from a BAM file and convert each read into a
single central point, returned as a \link[GenomicRanges:GRanges-class]{GenomicRanges::GRanges} object.
This is commonly used in footprinting or single-base signal profiling,
where only the center of each fragment is needed.
}
\examples{
bam_file <- system.file("extdata", "example.bam", package = "chromcall")
read_points <- load_read_locations(bam_file, paired = TRUE)
read_points
